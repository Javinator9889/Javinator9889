### üñ•Ô∏è A little bit about me...

I am a Computer Engineer currently studying a Master Degree in Distributed and Embedded Systems Software.

During the last years I worked on improving my knowledge about many different technologies and programming languages, alongside finishing my B. Sc. in Computer Engieneering & Science. That led me knowledge about:

* Server administration and management, including microservices deployment, handling a Docker cluster, webpages using NGINX and Apache, PHP backend and services, etc.
* DevOps culture: CI/CD using different technologies such as GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI and lately Azure DevOps.
* Design and development of complete ad-hoc hardware systems: from the process of designing to finally building and programming a PCB.
* Learning different languages for many purposes, such as Python, Kotlin, NodeJS, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, Golang, etc.
* Linux enthusiast and databases optimization: using a cache such as Redis for handling databases and their connections efficiently.
